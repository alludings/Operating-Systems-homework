To run the code, you have to do (go run (file name).go).
P1 has a simple counter that then produces results for the producer and consumer.
P2 uses the array to push and pop values throughout the stack with failsafes to make sure the code works properly.
Both use the fmt library, but P2 has the errors library as a failsafe for each test.
