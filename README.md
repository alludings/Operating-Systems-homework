To run the code, you have to do (go run (file name).go).
The p1 program uses two channels, one for sending numbers from the producer to the consumer, and the other for indicating and swapping every time. The producer generates numbers 1–5, and the consumer prints them in order, ensuring the output at the terminal always switches through the producer and the consumer. Just realize you can't use goroutine, sorry. 🙁 P2 uses the array to push and pop values throughout the stack with failsafes to make sure the code works properly. This is then tested in values of 10 up to 50, and then the values are popped to 0. Both use the fmt library, which contains basic Go functionalities, but P2 has the errors library as a failsafe for each test to ensure a proper output every time.
